# CS 261 Data Structures Handbook

By Austin Hendricks

This is a summary of the data structures I have mastered to this point. The importance of the different structures allows different variations of storage and organization. With the right data structure in play, the necessary time to access/remove/add data can be optimized. If we didn't have data structures and algorithms, we would need to pound code all day to cover any and all specific bases. Whereas data structures can take in input and organize it in a way that is most effective for the task at hand.

# Data Structures

## Abstract Data Types
 * [Sets](sets.md)
 * [Tuples](tuple.md)
 * [Dictionary](dictionary.md)
 * [Hash Tables](hash_table.md)
 * [Queues](queue.md)
 * [Deques](deque.md)

## Linear Data Structures
  * [Stacks](stack.md)
  * [Linked Lists / Doubly linked lists](linked_list.md)
  * [Array](array.md)
  
 ## Trees
  * [Binary Search Trees](binary_search_tree.md)
  * [AVL Trees (Balanced Binary Search Trees)](avl_trees.md)
  * [Stacks](stack.md)
  * [Queues](queue.md)
  * [Deques](deque.md)
  * Binary Heaps
  
 ## Graphs
